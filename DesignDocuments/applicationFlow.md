    Contact Information and logo design
    User decides whether they want to sign in or sign up

User Sign up

    User chooses to sign in or sign up
    They can click on any tab and it will not allow them to go forward without signing in
    User fills out the sign up form
    Submit
    Request goes to sign up servlet.
    Servlet creates a user object and then creates contact - user - role in the database.
    Response to user confirming addition (show a message on the jsp)

User Sign In

    User chooses Sign in button or can click on any part of navbar -- it will force a sign in or sign up
    This links them to the Sign in page
    User enters username and password on form and submits.
    If authentication fails, show error message/page and have a button to retry or go back to home
