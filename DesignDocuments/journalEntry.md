### Week 3
I think I am doing pretty good. I feel like I may be ahead. This is always nice just in case something sets me back. I
think the excercise 2 was easier than all the set up in week one. I was able to get a head start on my jsps on my indie
project.

### Week 4
Starting my database. It has been a challenge due to lots of relationships. I was able to seek help from a database teacher
which was a big help. I had my checkpoint two done early in the week to allow me to stay ahead.

### Week 5
This week I struggled with hibernate. It was small syntax errors. This week I fell more behind due to lots of time spent
on one error. Of course it was something simple that my eye just didnt catch. This allowed me to get better at the 
debugger.

### Week 6
Hibernate this week wasnt too bad, it was pretty straight forward for the one to many. Again my struggle was the database.
I had my id named different in my table. I am getting better at noticing these small details and ways to get around
them.

### Week 7
I am currently finishing up my checkpoint two. I submitted my peer reviews and am implementing hibernate into my indie project.
I am also finishing up my aws with my exercise 4. I am feeling slightly behind again. Hopefully this weekend I can get caught
back up with my indie project jsps, etc.

### Week 8
Aws was definitely a challenge to put into my indie project so I decided to just put it into my weekly exercise.

### Week 9
I am struggling with relationships in my project. I have one dao testing but now that I am adding other relationships it
now broken again. Attemping to put Aws, authentication, and jsps output into my indie project. This again has been a
struggle with my relationships.

### Week 10
Still working on checkpoint three. Authentication and my jsps seem to not be connected correctly.

### Week 11
My team is all teamed up and signed up - collaborating on what we will design for team project. My biggest struggle this
week is hibernate. I am working on a Many to Many and I have complications with it deleting my database.

### Week 12
Hibernate is working for team project. Now I am creating the Rest Service and converting to JSON. JSON and hibernate are
not cooperating. We found and @JSONIgnore annotation that solved this issue. Finished Multithreading.

### Week 13
Focusing on team project presentations. I think my team really pulled together and everything turned out great.

### Week 14
Trying to get caught back up on my indie project. Struggling with the CRUD. I have Read working. Create is almost there.
I see the light at the end of the tunnel. All my logs and journals are updated. It's crazy to look at everything I've
accomplished so far this semester!!!

### Week 15
I have spent most of the week trying to get my application flow a little bit more reasonable.
I took care of most of my issues created by paula and john from my peer review. I have deployed it
with tomcat authentication and an api --- all successful on aws.

### Week 16
I am very sick - worst timing ever I'd say! I am doing my best to do any last minute changes such as logs,
more generic tests, java doc, error handling, anything I can. Bummed I wasnt able to get full
crud working. I do have create and read though! Praying I pass this class
it was quite the adventure and learning experience. I am very glad I took it!
