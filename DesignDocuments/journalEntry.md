### Week 3
I think I am doing pretty good. I feel like I may be ahead. This is always nice just in case something sets me back. I
think the excercise 2 was easier than all the set up in week one. I was able to get a head start on my jsps on my indie
project.

### Week 4
Starting my database. It has been a challenge due to lots of relationships. I was able to seek help from a database teacher
which was a big help. I had my checkpoint two done early in the week to allow me to stay ahead.

### Week 5
This week I struggled with hibernate. It was small syntax errors. This week I fell more behind due to lots of time spent
on one error. Of course it was something simple that my eye just didnt catch. This allowed me to get better at the 
debugger.

### Week 6
Hibernate this week wasnt too bad, it was pretty straight forward for the one to many. Again my struggle was the database.
I had my id named different in my table. I am getting better at noticing these small details and ways to get around
them.

### Week 7
I am currently finishing up my checkpoint two. I submitted my peer reviews and am implementing hibernate into my indie project.
I am also finishing up my aws with my exercise 4. I am feeling slightly behind again. Hopefully this weekend I can get caught
back up with my indie project jsps, etc.
