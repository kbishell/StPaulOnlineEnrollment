# Kortney Bishell Individual Project

### Problem Statement

My 8 year old son attends a private gradeschool. Due to minimal funds his school has very little technology and resorts
to the old fashioned way of things, a paper trail. I have been trying to find ways to help out and contribute to his
school for a long time now, for this is where I went to school. My contribution is going to be creating an online
enrollment web app. This will allow them to go paperless but also allow for families to go in and add/edit their
information at the click of a button.
